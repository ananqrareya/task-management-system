# Task Management System

## Introduction
The "Task Management System" system is an advanced task management application designed to streamline the process of handling tasks from creation to completion. Developed using Spring Boot and integrated with JPA for database interactions, this system offers a robust solution for users needing efficient task tracking and management in a collaborative environment.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Create, update, retrieve, and delete tasks efficiently through a user-friendly interface.
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic email notifications keep team members informed when tasks are added or completed.
- **Completed Tasks Archive**: Completed tasks are automatically moved to a separate entity, maintaining a clear separation from active tasks.
- **RESTful API**: The system provides a RESTful API for easy integration with other applications or frontend frameworks.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: For backend development and application configuration.
- **Java Mail Sender**: For handling email notifications.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For ORM and database interaction.
- **MySQL Database**: For data storage (configurable).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or later
- Maven
- An SMTP server or configuration for email notifications

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/task-management-system.git
   cd task-management-system
   ```

2. **Configure application properties:**
   - Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database and email server details.

3. **Build the application:**
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Access the API:**
   - The API will be available at `http://localhost:9080/TDList`

## Usage
- **Add a new task**: POST `/newTask`
- **View all tasks**: GET `/AllTask`
- **Update a task**: PUT `/updateTask/{id}`
- **Complete a task**: PUT `/completedTask/{id}`
- **Delete a task**: DELETE `/deleteTask/{id}`

To integrate security as a part of the future features section, rather than listing it separately, you can describe how it will be enhanced and integrated into the overall development and scalability plans for the system. Here's how you could revise the **Future Improvements** section to include security enhancements within the context of broader system development:

---

## Future Improvements
- **Scalability Enhancements**: Optimize the system for higher loads and larger datasets, ensuring that as the system grows, it remains robust and responsive under varying operational demands.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Plan to integrate advanced user authentication and authorization mechanisms such as OAuth2 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This will secure API access and ensure that operations are performed only by authorized users, enhancing the overall security posture of the application.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Develop comprehensive analytics and reporting features to provide better insight into task management metrics. This will help in monitoring system usage and identifying potential security risks.
- **Enhanced Security Measures**: As part of ongoing development, focus on implementing robust security measures including data encryption both at rest and in transit, regular security audits to align with the latest security standards.

## Final Note
While the system may appear simple, it serves as a foundational project to stabilize and enhance backend development skills, particularly with Spring Boot. It acts as an effective learning tool for understanding and applying backend principles and technologies in real-world applications.
